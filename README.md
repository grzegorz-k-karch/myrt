## Things to remember when writing code

* use typedefs for normal, point vectors
* use spectrum class to represent color
* use time
* use differential rays
* bidirectional path tracing
* stochastic progressive photon mapping
* monte carlo integration
* acceleration structures
* progressive sampling
* interactive view
* how should integrator work? all on device?
* textures
* caustics
* irradiance caching
